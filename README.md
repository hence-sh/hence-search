# hence-search

Browse and search the Hence gallery to discover projects built with AI coding agents.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add hence-sh/hence-search
```

## What it does

This skill lets your AI coding agent search [hence.sh](https://hence.sh) for inspiration — browsing projects by keyword, topic, or just seeing what's trending.

Your agent will:
1. Search by keywords or browse by topic categories
2. Present results with title, pitch, agent/model info, and links
3. Offer to save inspiring project IDs for "inspired-by" linking when you share your own project later

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- A Hence account (sign up at [hence.sh](https://hence.sh))

On first use, the skill starts an OAuth device flow — your agent prints a code, you approve it in your browser, and the agent is authenticated automatically.

## Usage

Tell your agent:

> "Search Hence for CLI tools"

> "Show me what people are building with Claude Code"

> "Find some inspiration for a dashboard project"
